        is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
        dummy
        text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
        specimen
        book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
        essentially
        unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
        and
        more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at
        its
        layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed
        to
        using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and
        web
        page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many
        web
        sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
        purpose (injected humour and the like).

                Latin
                literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                Hampden-Sydney
                College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
                passage, and
                going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem

        repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

        comes
        from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
        written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
        first
        line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
